# **App Name**: TraceSmart

## Core Features:

- Conveyor Simulation: Implement a conveyor simulation to represent the movement of products through the traceability station.
- Sensor Simulation: Simulate sensor readings (camera/sensor) to mimic product identification upon arrival at the station.  Fake the different possible sensor results that might come up during the process
- Compliance Verification: Check RoHS compliance using simulated part metadata and sensor flags to represent material compliance.
- Batch ID Confirmation: Confirm Batch ID from simulated production input data to track the origin and manufacturing details.
- Data Matching: Match Device ID and Manufacturing Date via internal simulation logic that substitutes for a database connection.
- Simulated Label Display: Display a simulated label containing a QR code or barcode that includes Device ID, Batch ID, Manufacturing Date, and RoHS compliance information.
- AI-Powered Label Validation: Incorporate an OCR tool that validates simulated label print quality and content to detect errors.  The LLM uses the OCR to decide whether all required information is present and correctly formatted.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Electric blue (#7DF9FF) for a modern, high-tech feel that emphasizes innovation and precision.
- Background color: Dark navy blue (#1A237E) to provide contrast and highlight the interactive elements.
- Accent color: Neon green (#39FF14) for calls to action and status indicators to draw attention to important information.
- Body and headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for a clean, modern, and readable interface, suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Use minimalist, line-style icons to represent different product parameters and status indicators. The icons should be clear and easily understandable.
- Implement a grid-based layout to ensure a structured and responsive design. Prioritize key information with clear visual hierarchy.
- Use subtle animations to indicate data processing and validation status. Animate the simulated conveyor to show product movement through the station.
